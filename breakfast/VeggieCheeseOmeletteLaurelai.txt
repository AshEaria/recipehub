This veggie and cheese omelette is one i make at home, people have said its pretty good.

Required equipment.

14 inch non stick skillet.

Wide plastic spatula 

3 medium sized eggs

Vegetable oil

One bowl, same size you eat your cerial out of.

Household spoon

Chopped veggies of your choice. I prefer an onion sweet pepper mix you can buy at most major grocerie stores in the freezer section. 

Chopping your own fresh is fine.

Directions.

Crack eggs into bowl and use spoon to beat the eggs until the yolks and whites are mixed.

Take non stick pan and coat the bottom with oil, enough oil so that the entire bottom is covered in a thin layer.
This will use more oil than you think.

Heat pan with oil in it to medium high. Wait for the oil to heat up fully. If its smoking turn down your heat.

Pour mixed egg onto the pan. The bottom of the egg mix should cook very quickly. 

Use spatula to test if the bottom part of the omlette is cooked. if it peels off of the pan its cooked. 
If it leaves egg liquid or tears wait a few more seconds.
Add veggies and cheese in the middle of the egg mix once the bottom is cooked and moves freely.

Use spatula to flip one half of the cooked egg circle over itself. Forming a semicircle.

Let bottom half cook until it turns lightly brown, but dont let it burn.

Flip the omlette so that the top side is now on the bottom. This requires practice and a wide spatula. 

Beginners can slide the omlette onto a small plate, put another small plate on top, and then flip that.
Then slide the omlette back onto the pan.

Once both sides are light brown the cheese should be melted and the inside of the omlette egg should be cooked.

Cut open on a corner to verify this. If egg has not finished cooking cook for 30 addistional seconds each side until it is cooked.

Goes well with hot sauce of your choice.

Total time: Approx 10-20 minutes
