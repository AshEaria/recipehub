This cake will come out with a texture very similar to a pound cake - it doesn't taste of lemon all that much, but it's nice and sweet. The best part: once you use the yoghurt, you will use the yoghurt cup for measuring everything else - a X (1) in the ingredients means "one yoghurt cup full of X."

Ingredients and instructions: 

Put all ingredients into a large bowl in this order, mixing with a whisk at the marked points. 
- 1 lemon yoghurt
- Olive oil (1)
 Mix
 - Sugar (2)
 - The zest of 1 lemon
 - 3 eggs, beaten
 Mix
 - Self-raising flour (3)

 Mix until there aren't any curds left. It will be easier if the flour cups are added one by one. 
 Line a mould (I use a long one, about 3" wide by 3" deep by 12" long, but if it fits go for it) with aluminium foil (both for easy extraction and not having to clean butter off the mould later.) 
 Preheat the oven at 150° C (302° F). The recommended setting is the fan heating from all sides. 
 Put in the oven for 45 minutes. VERY IMPORTANT: Once it's in the oven, do not open the oven door, or the cake will end up collapsing in on itself. Depending on your oven, it might take a little more or a little less, keep an eye on it. 
 Take it out, let it cool, unmould it.
