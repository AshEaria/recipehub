Goes really well with the onion sauce also in this folder. This makes for several portions, so feel free to put it in the fridge; it's also good cold, though if you want it hot again I'd recomment reheating only the sauce rather than heating up the meat roll as well, since that will dry it out. 

Ingredients

- 1/2 kg of minced meat
- 4 eggs, beaten
- 1 sachet of powdered onion soup
- Raisins (amount to taste)

Instructions

Mix everything well and put it on top of a large sheet of aluminium foil. Wrap the entire thing with the foil and make a roll shape (can make two if you think it's too big.)
Put on an oven-safe tray and put in the oven (with the foil still): 160° C (320° F) for 40 minutes. 
Take it out when you can stab a knife through the middle and it comes out dry / clean.
