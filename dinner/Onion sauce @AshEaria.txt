Goes great with the meat roll also in this folder. Sweet and savoury at the same time. 

Ingredients

- 3 onions
- Oil
- 1/2 cup of white or sweet wine
- 1 bouillon cube
- Salt
- Pepper (if you like)

Instructions

Peel and chop the onions, then fry them in the pan in about a half-inch of oil on low heat. 
When the onions turn transparent, add the wine, bouillon cube, salt and pepper (watch out with the salt, the bouillon cube has a fair amount already.)
Keep on low heat. Take out when the sauce has gotten thicker, I can't give you a time estimate for this one so rely on your taste.
