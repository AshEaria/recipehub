I always do this when I have nothing but rice and cans in my pantry. Always good to make more than you need and put in the fridge for later in the week. 

Ingredients (serves 2)

- 1 cup of rice
- Splash of oil (any type)
- 2 cups of water
- 1/2 a bouillon cube (which flavor doesn't matter)
- 1/2 cup of sweet corn 
- 1/2 cup of peas

Instructions

Put the rice into a pot and add a little oil. Put on high heat and toast the grains a little, moving them around from time to time. 
Once they're a little brown, toss in the water and the half bouillon cube, using the wooden spoon to break it up so it dissolves. 
When the water is boiling, lower the heat to whatever will keep it at a simmer, cover it with a lid and don't uncover it for 10 minutes. 
At the 10 minute mark, open the lid, throw in the peas and corn and close it again so the steam stays in. Don't even stir it. Watch out, the steam's hot. 
Let it keep cooking for five minutes, then turn the heat off, open the lid and mix the rice in with the peas and corn with a fork.
